                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, which made me a walking reference of a 
                    carioca would be - not the one from the "novelas", but those who acquired the 
                    "cariocagem" from living the truthiness of the State and its city as well. 
                    It makes you while it breaks you, but it teaches you like no other place. <br>
                    While still in Rio, I've been a writer, social media assistant, photographer, 
                    producer, and many other roles. Including the one I'm still playing to this 
                    day as a professional: programmer.<br><br>
                    I moved to São Paulo in order to study Web Development formally at a 
                    front-end development bootcamp and since then I've been working both as 
                    front-end and back-end developer. <br>
                    It was one of the many plot twists to happen in my life and to be honest, 
                    the decision to change careers to programming was one of the best as it 
                    brought me to many chances I wouldn't even dream otherwise. <br><br>
                    I'm curious to the core, restless if not creating and I won't settle until 
                    I've solved a problem. It calms me down and it's a tool to create something 
                    useful, meaningful.
